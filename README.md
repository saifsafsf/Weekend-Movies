# Weekend-Movies

This program scrapes IMDB's box office charts of the recent week. It collects the following:
- Movie Title
- Weekend Sales
- Gross Sales
- Weeks (since release)
- Genres

### Technologies Used:
- Beautiful Soup
- Requests
- MatPlotLib.PyPlot

### Points to Note:
- The program scrapes the page bottom-up. Hence the data is gathered in ascending order
- For now, the program displays the weekend sales against movie titles using a scatter plot
- The genres are dispalyed using a legend
- To start the program, just run the .py file given

A lot more can be done using the data collected. We can use Weekend Sales against Weeks Released. Genres can still be displayed using the legend.
Feel free to suggest any change in the program.
